- Background color: Very light blue-green (#E0F2F1) to provide a calm, neutral backdrop that is easy on the eyes and evokes a sense of clinical cleanliness.
- Accent color: A subdued light-blue (#90CAF9) to highlight key interactive elements like buttons and links, creating a clear visual hierarchy and easy navigation.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern, readable look across all devices. It's clean and works well for both headings and body text, ensuring clarity.
- Use clean, professional line icons in the teal primary color (#26A69A) to represent product categories, support services, and key features.
- Employ a grid-based layout to ensure responsiveness across all devices. Use white space to create a clean, uncluttered interface. Maximize readability and scannability with clear sections and distinct visual hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth animations for transitions and interactions. For example, use fade-in effects, smooth scrolling, and button hover effects to enhance user experience without being distracting.
